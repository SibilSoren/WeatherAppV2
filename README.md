## Weather App project 

### I have used Bootstrap in this project, HTML , CSS and JavaScript in this project

Although there we should not use bootstrap for this small project, but it always saves time during devlopment, we dont have to create every style on our own , we can modify every style on top of the bootstrap according to out requirment.

I have used the OpenWeather API to the weather data

This is the one of the best free API to get the weather data, there are other alternative as well such as Dask Sky

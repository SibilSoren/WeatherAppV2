# WeatherAppV2

This is Weather App project 

I have used Bootstrap in this project, HTML , CSS and JavaScript in this project

## Although there we should not use bootstrap for this small project, but it always saves time during devlopment, we dont have to create every style on our own , we can modify every style on top of the bootstrap according to out requirment.

## I have used the OpenWeather API to the weather data
